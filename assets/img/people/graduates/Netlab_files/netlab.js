The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was published by Vinton Cert and Robert Kahn in 1974 split into TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) in 1978, and deployed as a standard on the ARPANet by 1983. An Internet congestion collapse was detected in October 1986 on a 32 kbps link between the University of California Berkeley campus and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that is 400 yards away, during which the throughput dropped by a factor of almost 1,000 to 40 bps. Two years later Van Jacobson implemented and published the congestion control algorithm in 1 the Tahoe version of TCP based on an idea of Raj Jain, K.K. Ramakrishnan and Dah-Ming Chiu. Before Tahoe, there were mechanisms in TCP to prevent senders from overwhelming receivers, but no effective mechanism to prevent the senders from overwhelming the network. This was not an issue because there were few hosts, until the mid-1980s. By November 1986 the number of hosts was estimated to have grown to 5,089 but most of the backbone links have remained 50 \u2013 56 bps (bits per second) since the beginning of the ARPANet. Jacobson\u2019s scheme adapts sending rates to the congestion level in the network, thus preventing the senders from overwhelming the network. The algorithm worked very well over a network with relatively low transmission capacity, small delay, and few random packet losses. This was mostly the case in the 1990s, but as the network speed underwent rapid upgrades (see Figure 1), as Internet exploded onto the global scene beyond research and education, and as wireless infrastructure was integrated with and mobile services proliferated on the Internet, the strain on the original design started to show.\\n"],[10],[0,"\\n\\n"],[7,"p"],[9],[0,"\\n  This motivated a flurry of research activities on TCP congestion control in the 1990s. A mathematical understanding of Internet congestion control started in the late 1990s with Frank Kelly\u2019s work on network utility maximization. An intensive effort ensued and lasted for a decade, in which we developed a mathematical theory to reverse engineer existing algorithms and understand structural properties of large-scale networks under end-to-end congestion control, systematically designed new algorithms based on analytical insights, and deployed some of these innovations in the field.\\n"],[10],[0,"\\n\\n"],[7,"p"],[9],[0,"A personal account of that effort, focusing on the theory development at Netlab, is summarized in:"],[10],[0,"\\n"],[7,"ul"],[9],[0,"\\n  "],[7,"li"],[9],[0,"\\n    S.

We show that not only can throughput be reduced when some link increases its capacity, more strikingly, it can also be reduced when all links increase their capacities by the same amount.

To this end, the power network, from generation to transmission and distribution to consumption, will undergo an architectural transformation in the following decades that the communication network has gone through in the last two. The traditional network has a small number of large generators that are actively controlled to meet the demand of a much larger number of passive loads. The control paradigm is to schedule supply to meet forecast demand. The future smart grid will have a large number of small distributed generation resources that are not dispatchable nor accurately predictable, as well as a large number active loads. Unlike most endpoints today that are merely passive loads, the future network of distributed energy resources (DERs) may generate, sense, compute, communicate, and actuate. These intelligent DERs will create a severe risk by introducing rapid, large, and random fluctuations in power supply and demand, voltage and frequency, as well as a tremendous opportunity for a clean energy future by drastically increasing our capability to coordinate and optimize their operation in real time."],[10],[0,"\\n\\n"],[7,"div"],[11,"class","row"],[9],[0,"\\n  "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-12 mx-auto d-flex justify-content-center"],[9],[0,"\\n    "],[7,"figure"],[9],[0,"\\n      "],[7,"img"],[11,"id","evolution"],[11,"src","/assets/images/research-areas/evolution.png"],[11,"alt","Power network evolution"],[9],[10],[0,"\\n      "],[7,"figcaption"],[11,"class","text-center"],[9],[0,"Figure 1: Power network evolution"],[10],[0,"\\n    "],[10],[0,"\\n  "],[10],[0,"\\n"],[10],[0,"\\n\\n"],[7,"p"],[9],[0,"Netlab\'s research focuses on some of the most fundamental challenges in this historic transformation."],[10],[0,"\\n\\n"],[7,"div"],[11,"class","row"],[9],[0,"\\n  "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-6"],[9],[0,"\\n    "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research bg-gray mb-3 py-3 clickable"],[9],[0,"\\n"],[4,"link-to",["research.power-systems-steady-state"],null,{"statements":[[0,"        "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","container"],[9],[0,"\\n          "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","row"],[9],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-7 order-md-1 my-auto"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"h5"],[9],[0,"Power Systems: Steady State"],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-5 order-md-1"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research-image bg-psss bg-cover w-100 h-100"],[9],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n          "],[10],[0,"\\n        "],[10],[0,"\\n"]],"parameters":[]},null],[0,"    "],[10],[0,"\\n  "],[10],[0,"\\n\\n  "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-6"],[9],[0,"\\n    "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research bg-gray mb-3 py-3 clickable"],[9],[0,"\\n"],[4,"link-to",["research.power-systems-dynamics"],null,{"statements":[[0,"        "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","container"],[9],[0,"\\n          "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","row"],[9],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-7 order-md-2 my-auto"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"h5"],[9],[0,"Power Systems: Dynamics"],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-5 order-md-1"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research-image bg-power-systems-dynamics bg-cover w-100 h-100"],[9],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n          "],[10],[0,"\\n        "],[10],[0,"\\n"]],"parameters":[]},null],[0,"    "],[10],[0,"\\n  "],[10],[0,"\\n\\n  "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-6"],[9],[0,"\\n    "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research bg-gray mb-3 py-3 clickable"],[9],[0,"\\n"],[4,"link-to",["research.electric-vehicles"],null,{"statements":[[0,"        "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","container"],[9],[0,"\\n          "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","row"],[9],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-7 order-md-1 my-auto"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"h5"],[9],[0,"Electric Vehicles (EV)"],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-5 order-md-1 clickable"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research-image bg-electric-vehicles bg-cover w-100 h-100"],[9],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n          "],[10],[0,"\\n        "],[10],[0,"\\n"]],"parameters":[]},null],[0,"    "],[10],[0,"\\n  "],[10],[0,"\\n\\n  "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-6"],[9],[0,"\\n    "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research bg-gray mb-3 py-3 clickable"],[9],[0,"\\n"],[4,"link-to",["research.communication-networks"],null,{"statements":[[0,"        "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","container"],[9],[0,"\\n          "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","row"],[9],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-7 order-md-2 my-auto"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"h5"],[9],[0,"Communication Networks"],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","col-md-5 order-md-1"],[9],[0,"\\n              "],[7,"div"],[11,"class","research-image bg-communication-networks bg-cover w-100 h-100"],[9],[10],[0,"\\n            "],[10],[0,"\\n          "],[10],[0,"\\n        "],[10],[0,"\\n"]],"parameters":[]},null],[0,"    "],[10],[0,"\\n  "],[10],[0,"\\n"],[10],[0,"\\n"]],"hasEval":false}',meta:{moduleName:"netlab/templates/research/index.hbs"}});e["default"]=n}),define("netlab/templates/research/power-systems-dynamics",["exports"],function(e){Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0}),e["default"]=void 0;var n=Ember.HTMLBars.template({id:"FQNSTLNO",block:'{"symbols":[],"statements":[[7,"h1"],[11,"class","display-4 mt-3"],[9],[0,"Research"],[10],[0,"\\n"],[7,"h2"],[11,"class","mt-3"],[9],[0,"Power Systems: Dynamics"],[10],[0,"\\n\\n"],[7,"p"],[11,"class","lead"],[9],[0,"The dynamics of a transmission network is mainly driven by that of the bulk generators.

The basic idea is to explicitly exploit power network as a power flow solver, update our control variables by taking a single first-order or second-order gradient direction and apply it to the network in each iteration, without waiting for the computation to converge. The network will solve the power flow equations in response of the control input and produce a new network state, which is then used to compute the next gradient iteration for the control variables, and the cycle repeats, as illustrated in Figure 2.
