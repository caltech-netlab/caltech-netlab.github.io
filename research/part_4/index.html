Our research FastTCP has been accelerating more than 1TB of Internet traffic every second circa 2014. See the Publications page for the full range of our work. In the following, we highlight some of our results in congestion control.</p> <ol> <li><b><a href="#conjestionControl">Congestion control</a></b></li> <li><b><a href="#layering">Layering as optimization decomposition</a></b></li> <li><b><a href="#other">Other interesting results</a></b></li> </ol> <div style="text-align:center;"> <figure> <img src="../../assets/img/research/communication-networks/FAST-timeline.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> <figcaption>Caltech FAST Project: FAST TCP accelerating &gt; 1TB of Internet traffic every second (2014).</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><font size="5.5" id="conjestionControl">Congestion control</font></div> <p>Congestion control has been responsible for maintaining stability as the Internet scaled up in size, speed, traffic volume, coverage, and complexity by many orders of magnitude over the last four decades, especially since late 1980s (see Figure 1). The Internet, called ARPANet at the time, was born in 1969 with four nodes. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was published by Vinton Cert and Robert Kahn in 1974 split into TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) in 1978, and deployed as a standard on the ARPANet by 1983. An Internet congestion collapse was detected in October 1986 on a 32 kbps link between the University of California Berkeley campus and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that is 400 yards away, during which the throughput dropped by a factor of almost 1,000 to 40 bps. Two years later Van Jacobson implemented and published the congestion control algorithm in 1 the Tahoe version of TCP based on an idea of Raj Jain, K.K. Ramakrishnan and Dah-Ming Chiu. Before Tahoe, there were mechanisms in TCP to prevent senders from overwhelming receivers, but no effective mechanism to prevent the senders from overwhelming the network. This was not an issue because there were few hosts, until the mid-1980s. By November 1986 the number of hosts was estimated to have grown to 5,089 but most of the backbone links have remained 50 – 56 bps (bits per second) since the beginning of the ARPANet. Jacobson’s scheme adapts sending rates to the congestion level in the network, thus preventing the senders from overwhelming the network. The algorithm worked very well over a network with relatively low transmission capacity, small delay, and few random packet losses. This was mostly the case in the 1990s, but as the network speed underwent rapid upgrades (see Figure 1), as Internet exploded onto the global scene beyond research and education, and as wireless infrastructure was integrated with and mobile services proliferated on the Internet, the strain on the original design started to show.</p> <div style="text-align:center;"> <figure> <img src="../../assets/img/research/communication-networks/ESnet-backbone-bandwidth.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> <figcaption>Figure 1: Highest link speed of US Department of Energy’s Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) from 1987 (56 kbps) to 2012 (100Gbps).</figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>This motivated a flurry of research activities on TCP congestion control in the 1990s. A mathematical understanding of Internet congestion control started in the late 1990s with Frank Kelly’s work on network utility maximization. An intensive effort ensued and lasted for a decade, in which we developed a mathematical theory to reverse engineer existing algorithms and understand structural properties of large-scale networks under end-to-end congestion control, systematically designed new algorithms based on analytical insights, and deployed some of these innovations in the field.</p> <p>A personal account of that effort, focusing on the theory development at Netlab, is summarized in:</p> <ul> <li>S. H. Low. <a href="../../assets/pdf/publications/Low-201707-CCbook.pdf"><b>Analytical methods for network congestion control</b></a>, <em>ISynthesis Lectures on Communication Networks</em>, Morgan and Claypool Publishers, July 2017</li> </ul> <p>It develops a coherent theory of Internet congestion control from the ground up to help understand and design the equilibrium and stability properties of large-scale networks under end-to-end control. It also demonstrates in depth the entire process of understanding a physical system, building mathematical models of the system, analyzing the models, exploring the practical implications of the analysis, and using the insights to improve a design.</p> <p><b>Duality model of congestion control.</b> Our work on congestion control started in the late 1990s at the University of Melbourne, as reported in:</p> <ul> <li>S.

It also proves that, provided that the stepsize of the algorithm is small enough, the system will converge even in an asynchronous setting with heterogeneous feedback delays where TCP sources and queue management mechanisms take actions at different times, with different frequencies and using possibly outdated information.

The characterization leads to the first counter-example and trivially explains all the previous supporting examples. Intuitively, we might expect that increasing link capacities always raises aggregate throughput. We show that not only can throughput be reduced when some link increases its capacity, more strikingly, it can also be reduced when all links increase their capacities by the same amount. These examples demonstrate the intricate interactions among sources in a network setting that are missing in a single-link topology that was commonly used in the TCP literature.</p> <p>When heterogeneous congestion control protocols that react to different pricing signals share the same network, the resulting equilibrium may no longer be interpreted as a solution to the standard utility maximization problem.

They cannot all be locally stable unless there is a globally unique equilibrium.
