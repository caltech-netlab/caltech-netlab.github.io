<b>PhD in Computing and Mathematical Sciences</b>
<br>
I am a PhD candidate interested in cyber-physical systems, in particular stability analysis and control of power networks. In the past I have researched pattern formation in dynamical systems. Outside of mathematics, I have a career as a cellist and continue to perform around the world--often with my three sisters who are all also musicians and mathematicians. Prior to joining Caltech, I received degrees in mathematics, music, and politics from Northwestern University, Harvard University, and Montana State University.
