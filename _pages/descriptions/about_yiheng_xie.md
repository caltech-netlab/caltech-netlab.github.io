<b>PhD Student in Computing and Mathematical Sciences</b>
I am a PhD student at Caltech CMS, focusing on the modeling, analysis and optimization of energy systems. I am intersted in research questions with rigor and relevance. I am currently building a large-scale cyber-physical testbed at Caltech, including high-resolution synchrophasors (PMUs) metering and controllable inverter-based resources.
