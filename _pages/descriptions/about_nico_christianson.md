<b>PhD Candidate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences</b>
<br>
I am a PhD student in CMS at Caltech, where I am advised by Steven Low and Adam Wierman, and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. In my research, I am broadly interested in designing algorithms for online optimization, control, and learning, with an emphasis toward applications in energy and sustainability.
