This rough draft is based on lecture notes for the Power System Analysis course that I have been teaching at Caltech for the last decade or so. It contains incomplete or empty sections, errors and inconsistencies, missing bibliographical notes, etc. Any corrections, questions, comments, or pointers will be greatly appreciated!

We will periodically add new chapters and update existing ones here. We will also inform registered users of (only) major updates (very occasionally, and you can always opt out of notification). Please do register (if you have not already).

- Part I: Single-phase networks (Ch 1 - Ch 5; ignore Ch 6)
- Part II: Unbalanced multiphase networks (Ch 7 - 10)
- Part III: Power flow optimization (Ch 11 - 15)
- Part IV: Appendix: Mathematical preliminaries (Ch 25)

Solutions to most of the exercises are available to instructors for teaching or researchers for self study.  Request solution.
